# System-Simulation
Simulation of shockwave traffic jam using bond graph

Contains two main programs; one modeled with a source and a dampening and another without, using euler schemes.

The Bond graph representation and the associated ODEâ€™s which are implemented in 
MATLAB In both models, traffic behavior is investigated on a circular road with
one lane. The simulations are compared with a traffic shock wave experiment 
performed in Japan. In the first program, each car responds to the behavior of
the vehicle in front and behind it.
